# Roof Slapping Bot

This is the code that powers [@RoofSlappingBot](https://twitter.com/RoofSlappingBot).

All of the magic is in `data.json`, which I more or less manually scraped from [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io).

This code is designed to be run on a schedule, once every X hours, as a cron job.
